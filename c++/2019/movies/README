===== Instructions

To compile, run "make". (Requires g++, jsoncpp and curl)

To run the program, run "./movies --search A MOVIE TITLE"

===== Quick Files/Classes Overview

- main.cpp contains the main function for the command line implementation of this program.
   It handles the parameters sent by the user and prints search results as simple text on the terminal.
   The search request are handled through an instance of OmdbApi.
  
- Class OmdbApi: this class manages OMBD's REST API operations, formatting request URLs, parsing and 
   storing results. The results are parsed with the help of JSONCPP classes. The HTTP communication is
   handled using an instance of the class CurlRest.
   
- Class CurlRest: this class encapsulates functions from the CURL library, to perform HTTP GETs.

===== Observations:

While only a command line version of this program is made available, the class OmdbApi was designed to be
re-usable in a QT application, and expandable to manage more OMBD REST API operations.
